## 🔔 Step 5: Follow-Up Sequence

### Follow-Up #1 (Day 3)

**Subject:** Quick question about your website proposal

```
Hi [Name],

Just wanted to check in - did you get a chance to review the proposal I sent on [Date]?

I noticed you haven't accepted yet, so I wanted to make sure:
1. The proposal email didn't get lost in your inbox
2. You don't have any questions I can answer
3. The pricing/timeline works for you

If you need any changes to the proposal, I'm happy to adjust!

Otherwise, here's the payment link again:
[Stripe Payment Link]

Looking forward to hearing from you,
[Your Name]
```

### Follow-Up #2 (Day 7)

**Subject:** [Name], your proposal expires tomorrow

```
Hi [Name],

Quick heads up - your website proposal expires tomorrow ([Expiry Date]).

After that, I'll need to update the pricing based on my current availability (I have 2 new projects starting next week).

If you want to lock in the current price and timeline, just click here:
[Stripe Payment Link]

If the timing isn't right, no worries! Just let me know and we can revisit in a few months.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

P.S. If you're on the fence, check out this recent project I just launched: [Example URL]
```

### Mark as Lost (Day 14)

If no response after 2 follow-ups, mark as "Lost - No Response" in your CRM and move on.

Send one final email:

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

```
Hi [Name],

I haven't heard back from you, so I'm assuming now isn't the right time for a new website.

No problem! I'll close your file for now.

If you want to revisit this in the future, just reply to this email.

Best of luck with [Business Name]!

[Your Name]
```

**This often triggers a response** - people don't like things being "closed."

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Increase Close Rate:

1. **Limited Time Offer** - "This price is valid for 7 days only"
2. **Show Scarcity** - "I only take on 2 projects per month"
3. **Include Bonus** - "Book this week and get a free logo refresh ($500 value)"
4. **Make It Easy** - One-click payment link (not a quote request form)
5. **Remove Risk** - "100% money-back guarantee if not satisfied"

### Track Everything:

- When proposal was sent
- When they opened it (use email tracking)
- When payment link was clicked
- Follow-up dates
- Reasons for lost deals

### Common Objections & Responses:

**"It's too expensive"**
→ "I understand. Let me show you the ROI: If this website brings in just 2 extra customers per month at $X each, it pays for itself in Y months."

**"I need to think about it"**
→ "Of course! What specific concerns do you want to think through? I'm happy to address them now."

**"Can you do it cheaper?"**
→ "I can create a scaled-down version for $X. Here's what would be included: [List]. Would that work better?"

**"I need to talk to my partner"**
→ "Great! Would it help if I joined a call with both of you to answer any questions?"
